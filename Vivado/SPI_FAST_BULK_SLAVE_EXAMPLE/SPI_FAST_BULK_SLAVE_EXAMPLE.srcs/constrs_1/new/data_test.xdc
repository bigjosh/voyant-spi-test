# Next we need the SPI clock. this will come form the MCU and clock out the 
# bits from the FPGA.

# We will switch to this when loading the test program onto the Voyant PCB
# but someone should double check this PACKAGE_PIN is correct, and also the IOSTANDARD

# This is where the MCU MULTI_SPI_CLK connects to the FPGA based on the 
# Voyant PCB and the Trendz spreadsheet. Currently output from MCU as master
# and input to FPGA, although would be better to have the FPGA be master,
# but a little scary becuase they could somehow both end up driving that line 
# at the same time and that would be bad.

# We picked this pin becuase it is no-connection on the Voyant PCB so
